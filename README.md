# vidmusic-remover
Removes music from videos using Demucs (GUI Now complete).

Why Demucs? 
After testing multiple other AI Models and python libraries, only demucs was able to remove the music completely from a YT video that I specifically wanted music removed for.

Other audio separators that were tested had mixed results and none of them worked aswell as Demucs.

Works in progress:

Working on instructions for installation on other devices, definetely requires Demucs & PYQT.

Working on usage for other audio file formats, this is just a prototype/wip

C++ version being developed with QT atm.
