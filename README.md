# vidmusic-remover
Removes music from videos using Demucs (Gui and other platform usage wip)

Why Demucs? 
After testing multiple other AI Models and python libraries, only demucs was able to remove the music completely from a YT video that I specifically wanted music removed for.

Other audio separators that were tested had mixed results and none of them worked aswell as Demucs.
